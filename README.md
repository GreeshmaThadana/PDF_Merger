PDF_Merger:

This Python script utilises the PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files ("1.pdf" and "2.pdf") into a single PDF document named "merged.pdf". The script iterates through the list of input PDFs, opens each file, reads its content using PyPDF2, appends the content to a PdfMerger object, and finally writes the merged content into a new PDF file. This straightforward project simplifies the process of combining PDF documents using a concise and effective Python script.
